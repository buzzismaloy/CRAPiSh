# CRAPiSh

CRAPiSh is a simple implementation of a shell in C. It demonstrates the basics of how a shell works.

This shell implementation has some limitations:

* Commands must be on a single line.
* Arguments must be separated by whitespace.
* No quoting arguments or escaping whitespace.
* No piping or redirection.
* Only builtins are: `cd`, `help`, `exit`.
